social media has always been kinda hard. I remember, many years ago, when I recoiled at Friendster (showing my age here) after someone invited me to join. The fact that you had to write testimonials about your friends, telling everyone how fun/hot/great/awesome they were brought up a deep, painful rage - the rage of damaged self esteem and childhood bullying and never really feeling like you were an actual person, let alone loved. And so I never joined.

I had a myspace, and I had some friends on it - that wasn't so bad, but at the same time, I felt a deep sense of shame associated with it: I'd secretly look people up I had crushes on, and just as secretly feel like anything I might post was completely insufficient.

Facebook, even in its early days, with its insistence on real names and privacy controls felt sometimes intoxicating, and sometimes straight up poisonous. I was always the person who unfriended people when I couldn't bear the intensity of keeping them in my life after another misunderstanding or breakup. It never felt neutral, to me, and I never felt comfortable with having parts of my life behind a wall, visible only to "friends" and "followers". And even more so, I never felt comfortable having prescribed windows into other people's lives. Sometimes things came through those windows that felt like they might shatter me. And so I oscillated between obsessively checking facebook for every tiny update, trying to drive up my follower count, and switching the whole thing off and throwing it away. And I frequently did, for months at a time. 

Instagram felt similar, but maybe even worse: words are my medium, not photography: I became sad and perfectionistic, fretting a lot about what i might post and who followed me and who didn't.

My concerns are, now, more easily summed up than ever before.

I struggle(d) to allow people I was developing relationships with to see me.\
\
To see me with my boring updates and my bad photography and my lack of selfies and my lack of fun rad group shots, my bad lighting and uninteresting captions and silly updates. For some reason, when we draw a line around who can see and who can't, all I can think about is the edges and the opinions that might live there.

In my previous long term relationship, we weren't connected on social media for the first six months, and even when we were, it was never an easy co-existence. 

Twitter was the first social media network I felt truly at home in. I had a bunch of false starts - I didn't get how to use it, how to sift through the noise, the randomness. If instagram is like a perfectly lit room with a curated soundtrack playing and a stack of hipster plants on copper-bracketed shelves, twitter can be a bit like an interrogation room with a spotlight shining in your face one moment and a dark alley the next. But something clicked with me after years of false starts. I started loving my experience on twitter, and I didn't really stop to consider why I was enjoying connecting with people and seeing random content as much as I did.

Until I realized I had a public twitter profile.

Somehow, the act of knowing that anybody anywhere could see anything I wanted to tweet about (and knowing that this is true for the vast majority of people on twitter) and realizing I didn't really care, I became free. I didn't have to worry about tweeting something some people loved and other people hated. If everything is public, I didn't have to worry about needing to re-request people if I changed my mind, and them therefore knowing I had unfriended them at some point. It became about consent - by understanding everything was public, I consented to sharing information in a different way. If everything is public, then everyone is equal. There is no hierarchy except the hierarchy of relationship - if you comment on something or post, or RT it, and we develop a relationship, then we receive the gift of understanding each other in complexity. And consent is about choice.

For me, the illusion of privacy in "closed" social media is inherently fraught with anxiety. Because it is a closed circle, it feels inherently excluding and relational. And relationships, for me, can cause me to worry a lot about What You Might Think. In public social media, I am more inclined to say: "Don't like it? Look away. You are not bound to me. If you want to choose me, warts and all, then do."

These feelings have complexified over the years. I now have a private alt twitter I use to tweet not-safe-for-work and more private topics with a select group of friends. My job requires that I spend time on twitter, and I started feeling a bit overexposed. If I had a different job, or didn't reference my work in my twitter, I would prefer to have a completely public account. Maybe someday, again. For now, this works.

**So here's the thing. Let's return to what I said earlier, slightly rewritten:**

I struggle to allow people to see me. My perceived flaws. My fears. My clumsyness. My awkwardness. The things I don't know how to do well. Where I stumble. Where I feel shy.

It sounds strange coming from someone who does a lot of public speaking, has a very open personality, generally speaking, and who is writing this on a blog that is accessible to the public.

But there are large parts of me - my history, my experiences, my thoughts, my opinions, topics I know a lot about and am interested in, amongst others - where I can be very secretive. I don't always know what I want (even if I definitely know when I didn't get it) and I don't know how to talk about it. I hide - a lot. People call me standoffish and cold, and what they don't know is that it because I can be very reclusive. Why? Pain, mostly. Rejection. Not getting a chance to grow up and feel loved, or interested in, or worthy of anyone's time. 

When you have to fight for scraps as a child, you might learn that scraps are all you deserve. And if you are forced to come to terms with that, you might dress scraps up like a feast, pretending its what you wanted all along. When you are the kind of kid who was very alone growing up, you might think that no one else can or wants to understand you. And then you might turn feeling like an outsider into feeling special, just to have so goddamn agency for once.

This isn't about pity. Its about choice: I didn't have any. And I'm painfully, slowly, gradually, as I creep towards the 4th decade of my life, learning that I get to make choices. Bad ones, stupid ones, unfair ones, ones I regret, ones that allow me to sleep at night, ones that make me feel whole and beautiful. I get to choose which words to use, which language to speak, what to eat. How to let someone touch me. And whether or not I want to draw a circle around certain parts of my life - or not.

And I've learned this, too: after the worst thing that you had been dreading for longer than you can remember happens (being assaulted. Losing a parent to cancer. Getting divorced, or, whatever these big things are for you) you get to choose how you move forward. And move forward you will, somehow.

My choice is to start being a lot more public. (which is why I am carving out small niches of privacy.) My choice is to make this blog more public. Dole out the URL. My choice is to talk about relationships, sex, mental health, healing, drugs, travel, queerness, injury recovery, culture, house music, bdsm, home interiours, friendship, magnetism, spirituality, wisdom, technology and any other bonkers shit that I can think of.

I'm also making my instagram public too.

So. See me, read me, hear me, talk to me, or don't. 

I'm giving you the choice now, instead of making it for you.
