This week was one for the books. The work, the grief, the work, the grief. But grieving is something only alive people do. As is being scared, trying and failing, falling short, making mistakes, repeating toxic patterns - I prefer alive to perfect.

Last weekend, a RT of a thread on crying at work, and how hard that is, especially for women, went viral. And because people are starving for affection and attention and love, quite a few people's DMs were intense stories of grief and loss and isolation and overwhelm.

(by the way, if you are reading this, get in touch, probably via twitter DM, and I will get you an invite for the community I'm building to talk about these kinds of things.)

On Monday, I had the meeting that was putting me on edge. After a difficult breakup of a long, close knit relationship about  12-14 months ago ( initiated, depends on when you start counting), my ex and I are filing for a divorce. It's been a very, very challenging journey.

I didn't sleep - also nervously heading into Tuesday's follow up appointment with my surgeon. The nervousness returns a few days before every follow up - a lurking panic that I will have to undergo the nightmare of a third invasive lower abdominal surgery again.\
(My bones are doing great. Outstanding. Amazing. Better than textbook. I am, as I aim to be, ahead of the curve.)

On wednesday it was the 4 month anniversary of getting hurt.

I'm still digesting what it means to be heading towards fine.\
 \
Over the last 14 months, I was, at first, trying to save a failing relationship that felt more and more suffocating and controlling by the minute, then dealing with the heartbreak and pain of the breakup, rebuilding my life, then getting hit by a vehicle and nearly dying.\
\
And that's just the big stuff. I was unemployed for 3 months, had to leave a house I loved, I quit a job that was very identity-defining, I went to 10 different tech conferences all over the globe, some of which I spoke at or MCd. My career exploded. I had a travel schedule that involved germany, the us and australia within 72 hours. And I somehow found time to write and drink and make a stack of new friends and find my dream job. And blow the dream job out of the water. What the fuck.

I'm exhausted. But I've also never been more alive.\
\
I want this. I want this and I want more. I've never wanted more.\
More life than that.\
The big engine inside my body that eats up life tends to grow restless, bored, noisy and impatient when I'm forced to go slow and abide by too many plans and restrictions. But being as injured as I was, that engine grew quiet, and I used all my determination and focus to get better.

Now I'm slowly getting better and the engine is roaring. I need food. I need feeding.

I live off many things.\

* quiet. unspoken connections. being alone. nature. being outside. being careful. love. nurturing. protection. puzzles. observation. strategy.\
* loud. let the chips fall where they may. people. attention. sex. music. drinking. food. volatility. random coincidences. boundaries ignored. loud loud loud alive alive alive alive.

I have never wanted to be so alive as now, now that i for sure know I am not dead and don't want to be dead.

At the same time I know just how quickly it can all change.

I am more impatient and less docile than ever before.

Like a homing missile I will find the things and people I need before I even know what for.

The catalyst I know myself to be will speed up and unfold things for the people's lives I affect.

Now is a really interesting time for you to be in my life.

I'm recording a podcast tomorrow.

Back on my bullshit.
