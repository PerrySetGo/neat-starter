**this post is raw & it talks about sex. Do what you need to do.**

As you maybe already know, I suffered what some medical professionals and definitely personal injury attorneys consider a "catastrophic injury". I'm not sure where an injury turns into being "catastrophic" - maybe somewhere between the lacerated liver (grade 4 of 6, don't google it),  and the fractured vertebrae, the lag bolts through my sacro-iliac joint, the 5 surgeries and the blood clot cage, the external fixation and the chronic pain - but i've heard this term enough now that it has a somewhat familiar ring to it. The first time I heard it I was caught off guard at it's clean, precise, and some way liberating self-evidence - yes, I was catastrophically injured. That is absolutely true. I remember looking in the mirror at age 16 and saying to myself "you are a homosexual" and the person in the mirror nodded back at me, timidly, yes, but in agreement.

Now I can tell the person in the mirror "you were catastrophically injured and nearly died" and I can nod in agreement the same way. And while we're at it - let's also add another scoop of ice cream to this disclaimer sundae - "you are an almost 39 year old about-to-be-divorced queer butch fag queen lesbian pansexual dyke fairy, and you were catastrophically injured and nearly died, on christmas no less, of last year." Enthusiastic nodding, yes, that happened.

I'm all of those things. And in a way, they are inseparable from each other: If I hadn't been single this past christmas, i wouldn't have thrown a solstice dinner party on December 21st, to which my new friend Tami wouldn't have brought a chicken, and I also wouldn't have been living in a studio loft, and i wouldn't have tried making chicken stock, which, guess what, makes a studio smell like a lot of chicken fug because there is no kitchen door to close, so i wouldn't have gone out biking to my other new friend Kate's house on christmas...

Who the fuck knows, and, more importantly, who the fuck cares. The point here isn't to examine the amazing nuance, depth, the polyvocality of the universe....whatever the fuck ever. **It's time to start feeling better! Forget the past! Do happy things, life things, exciting things! Dating!** Running romantically through the rain! Spontaneous hikes with new dates! Throwing each other around. Passionate new beginnings. The beauty of a new-to-me body. Being someone else's source of pleasure. Yes, pleasure.

**Wait a second.**

**None of those things** feel straightforward or accessible or possible to me right now.

I went on a few dates with 1-2 people since getting out of my long relationship in January 2018. But really, its been very, very quiet with regards to all that. I had feelings to sort out and work through. There was a lot to think about and process, meeting new people was hardly a top priority. And there was someone who meant a great deal to me but who never got her act together. I mean, last year, alone, I split from my partner, moved out, left my job, was unemployed, found a new job, became a citizen, went to 10 conferences, spoke at a bunch of them, MC'd some, travelled internationally to Germany and Australia, tried to figure out the separation situation/divorce process with my ex, and then just as life was stabilizing and I was making new friends and getting some ground back underneath my feet, and thinking about starting to date again, I got hit by a car. **Fuck.**

And while my recovery has been going so incredibly well...

...there has been such an absence of physical affection and, yes, sexuality, in my life for a long time now. I was in breakup mode for a a while.  And I wasn't pursuing that after my breakup. I wasn't pursuing that after my accident-until now. My injuries are predominantly in an intimate, personal place. For months I flashed my crotch to doctors, nurses, cna's, surgeons, nursing students, more nursing students...every day.. I am so, so, so, so lucky I am not more dysphoric than I am around my gear! For crying out loud. Literally hundreds of people saw my junk over the last few months and not in a good way. And nobody ever touched my skin without wearing nitrile gloves. I started to feel, felt, very medicalized. I lost touch with myself as a vessel that carries my heart and soul and fire around. I lost touch myself as a bringer of pleasure to others. I don't remember what that feels like, to admire and be admired and desired. **And that stuff is already SO FRAUGHT and SO HARD to access for queers and nonbinary not-cis gender weirdoes ANYWAY. oh my goodness there is so much to unpack here.**

**There are physical things.** Scars and more scars, and incisions and bumps and swelling in places people don't have them. I look at them every day and they look perfect to me because i am alive and they are so much better than they were. But they are also a constant reminder. A reminder of mortality and the importance of a moment. Of a breaking. A vulnerability. Not everyone can handle looking at that, thinking about that. And it's slashed right across my pubic area so enjoy the view.

**There are limitations.** My range of motion sucks. I am still in quite a bit of pain. I can't run romantically through the rain. I can't hike. I can't stand at a music venue. I can't sit on certain kinds of seating without being in pain. I can't bike. I was just able to dance at a club a tiny bit the other day for the first time. Can I have someone lie on top of me? I'm not sure. I think so. Can I do certain things I enjoy doing? I'm not sure. I fractured my pubic bone, so no, I guess I'm not able to do some things. **_Have you seen those early x-rays._** (no.)

Some people become completely non-functional and lose sensation after severe pelvic fractures. I am not in that category. Which is amazing. I am, again and again, so incredibly lucky. And in time, i hope, my pain will keep going down (although it has been pretty stable, this relationship i have with Mr Pain, for some time now, we're going steady) and my range of motion will improve (also not 100% sure how likely that is)

**But it's also more, much more than this.**

I don't need to be anyone's mercy or pity fuck. Really, I don't.

I don't want to be in a relationship right now. I'm not in need of emotional support. I have myself. Stronger than ever. Fantastic friends who make me feel loved and cared for. An amazing therapist.

But at the same time...

...

**This form has been through so much.**

So much pain.

So much suffering.

So much fear.

So much repair.

So. Much. Damage.

So much pain.

Discomfort.

This heart has seen so much pain, shown so much resilience, so much fighting, pushing, persevering, believing, demanding. So much patience. So much damage. So many setbacks. So much trauma.

And grief.

And grief.

And grief.

And grief.

I can't...

...

It can't be ignored.

I can't be dating or sleeping with someone who is afraid of me, of how broken I was recently. Who expects me to just function. That's -

\- some real deep shit for me that I still struggle with that goes way beyond this accident-

I cannot, I will not, just "keep functioning".  I am never going to be quite the same and I wouldn't want to be. Big things have happened to me all my life that people preferred to downplay and ignore as it helped them feel less responsible for the fallout that suddenly was all mine to cope with. Not now, not here, not me, not this.

If you are scared of me, **leave me the fuck alone. Don't ask me to prove to you life isn't scary. It is fucking scary.** I cannot process this with you right now.

If you are scared you might feel too much for me - love, worry, desire - **go deal with it somewhere else away from me.** I cannot limit myself or help you have boundaries right now.

If you are scared of my vulnerability, and feel an urge to push, pull, poke, hurt, damage, tease, silence, control or anger me because you can't deal with your own feelings **GO THE FUCK AWAY.**

## **I SAID**

# **GO AWAY.**

I want to be able to want someone and not have to worry about that.

I want myself.

I need to come back to life in this way. I miss dating.  Come here. I miss desire. I miss bodies of all kinds. And genders. Come here! I miss laughter and awkwardness and being surprised. I miss feeling valuable because i take pleasure- my own and others- seriously. Dan savage wrote "good, giving and game" about me you know.  Come here. Don't leave.

But I can't, won't be with anyone who isn't prepared to alter how sex works and their expectations of what hotness is and who can't handle my scars and also the big emotions that can come up for someone (not someone - ME) as I reconnect with my body and feel others connect to it. It can't be so casual I can't cry. And no, if i should cry, i probably don't want to rope you into a relationship. I AM HEALING AND GRIEVING. It may happen that i fucking break down. I can handle my shit. **I don't need anyone's pity, it's not helpful.**

I need that care and despite being a lonely randy queer with a brokenish body who is way overdue I will turn folks away who can't deliver here. **I am not a burden.** And my injuries and my body and, also, my divorce and all the other ten tons of crazy ass SHIT I have lived through and fought for and somehow dealt with are also not a burden. They are an opportunity. I am an opportunity to connect with something very real and raw. I can love and desire you as you are because i have learned to accept all this imperfection and struggle in me.

I want life. And in it, love. And with that, lust. And I am hurling perfection and expectations out the window these days.

The lover(s) that will come along will hopefully, ideally, be excited about me as I am, excited to show up for this next part of the journey. That's what I want. I'm so worth it. It's so rad to be alive and healing and figuring things out. But its not for everyone (see the go away section)

So.

I have a person I'm talking to, who lives far away but who makes me very hot under the collar, and we haven't even met, and she knows exactly how I'm doing, because she has her own big story  & life about bodies and challenges and mobility and pain. And she is inspiring me in all kinds of ways. If you read this, you know who you are.

I have a date on Thursday with one of the people I didn't meet up with this weekend.

In the interest of honesty and transparency, i have hinted that "i am in a place where I need to be careful". My date doesn't know what that means yet. I guess I'll find out. I have no idea what to expect. I'll probably be totally overwhelming and way too much as per usual - at least now, I have a good fucking reason.
