anecdotes about lighting fires are everywhere in language. I feel like we use incendiary references a lot: sparks, smoke, fire, burning, embers, flame, and coals. 

But who will talk about the maintenance of fire?

it's so easy to set fire to something, even on a wet day - throw some lighter fluid at it, if you have to, but the process of maintaining stays the same even in adverse conditions: not too much fuel, not too little, not too much air, not too much space.

Relationships are often deemed analogous to this process, right, we don't want to suffocate, nor underfuel it.

But what do you do when you are through with the past, but the past isn't through with you? when _not disclosing_ feels dishonest and doesn't explain why I'm acting this way or that, but that disclosure, because there is....just SO MUCH feels like it can only have the potential outcome of the thing you are trying to let bud flame out.

I feel like that sometimes. There's been a lot of complicated history and damage done in the last 39 years, and while I feel like I have a map of most of it and know where the tender spots live and even visit them sometimes, something came up for me the other day that I didn't expect and it threw me.

I have gone on a few dates with a person I met online - they have been long and intense dates, 4 hours, 5 hours, intense discussion and honest disclosure at first just around where we were at and now, increasingly, where we are coming from and what we are bringing, and now, boom, I'm in this situation where I reacted to something from a wounded emotional place, and I started feeling all my edges and then those edges started closing in and I felt more dysfunctional, broken and damaged than I have in a long time. Not just physically, although not feeling like I have access to the body and habits I know is part of this disorientation, but emotionally as well, in fact, predominantly.

My relationship (6 1/2 years, married for 5 1/2) and especially its failing has left me with a lot of smashed crockery to sift through.

I feel deeply unable to trust people sometimes. I do OK up to a certain point, and then the walls go up in an instant.

I can't handle even a whiff of an attempt to control me. To the point where my date, speaking of her schedule and her other dates, and letting me know that we would have to actually plan ahead and schedule times to see each other left me on such high alert I nearly bailed. It was unmistakable to both of us that I was reacting strongly.

**Why?**

Having someone assert that they could only see me on specific dates/times felt enough enough like my relationship, which was dominated by attempts to control me, double standards around my time and energy, and punishing me for having very normal expectations, that I became completely activated and stressed out. I panicked and made some superficial statements, not knowing, myself, why I was reacting so strongly.

Now, I don't rationally believe or want to control my date's schedule. And not only because we have only known each other for a few weeks. (that would be absurd. Even if we had been dating for a while it would be absurd. This is exactly the kind of control i am not interested in re-creating AT ALL.) I don't rationally want to be dating monogamously, or want my date to be dating monogamously! Not the point. Not the point at all. I don't rationally feel less-than because time needs to be scheduled instead of happening spontaneously. My own schedule is nuts - between working and activism and travel and conferences and pt and gym time and friends - i am rarely available on short notice.

But I reacted and that's what happened and even this tiny, tiny constriction - and it wasn't even my constriction, it was my date's constriction, around her schedule, and her time, but it did affect/touch my life - was enough to send me into quite a tailspin.

I was surprised at myself and thought deeply about this as I went to the coast. Building a fire, burning things, grieving intentionally, writing, I tried to understand how my date had managed to snag a splinter that has been driven into me so deeply and so long ago that I barely knew it was there. And not just by the thing my date said - but by a long and dotted line of moments in my life where I had absolutely no control over what was happening to me. 

I spent a long time this weekend and this week feeling all the layers of trauma and grief and resilience gently flex inside and around me, part prison, part protection. I remembered actually having PTSD at some point in an acute sense: Flashbacks, nightmares, anger, drinking uncontrollably after my mother died. I remembered what it felt like to be dealing with the mental health struggles I have faced since my youth, but that have largely (not completely) subsided: self harm, trauma, ideation, paranoia, intense mood swings, isolation, anger & rage, and a hugely ramped up fight-or-flight response to physical and emotional trauma along with some sensory...quirks i already naturally have. I felt pretty dysfunctional and messy this weekend, and like a lot to deal with, unsure if I was really ready to be unleashed on the world. In fact, I'm still not sure I am. The fact that I know that I have a lot of great things going doesn't offset everything. 

And there is something else, too: I don't want to be dark. I don't want to be the person that leads with their trauma and grief and mess. I don't want to come with those disclaimers. There is a staunch part of me that wants to scream because it is just so unfair. I deeply, deeply reject "deserving" or "agreeing to" any of the abuse I have experienced, whether that be psychological, sexual, relational, systemic, at the hands of my fucked up educational history that was quite abusive,  government immigration policies that trapped me in a cycle of poverty for years, or physical in terms of violence on my body at the hands of others, from homophobic assaults on the street from strangers or myself through self harm. I want to staunchly defend my date's right to _set her own fucking schedule and not have to worry about this sort of response._ But still i hurt. The body doesn't lie.

It's the long reach of trauma that insists that even when we are so far away that we are always both reminded and responsible for the maintenance of these very dark gifts. They are placed in our hands via assault, neglect, violence, they tarnish our relationships to both other people and to ourselves, and we can't give them to anyone else without continuing the cycle of harm.

It feels like so much to be asked to do when there its not obvious where the fucking reward is.

It brings me to wonder whether there is a way for people with a lot of residue to be able to be lighthearted together. And that makes me sad, because losing that lightheartedness feels like yet another theft.

I don't know what the answer is, I have been awkward and spiky and unfocused all week, unsure of myself, tainted.

I don't want to ask for help, or absolution, or anything like that from someone I have just met. I want to just be able to leave these things aside and enjoy myself after all i've done, been, fought, through.

What way out is there for this situation? I'm not sure. I wish I knew. There will be one, but I don't know if maybe all it will come with is more grief, whether we can contain the fire or have already done too much and it needs to go out because it burns too brightly, illuminating our every insufficiency.
