Almost 6 years ago my mum died. There were a lot of harrowing things about her passing, along with some beautiful ones. They are all windows into a house full of riddles - it looks different from everywhere you look.

I didn't get to have any say on my mother's funeral.
I didn't get to decide when and where she was cremated and buried.
I didn't get to decide who came, what the music was like, or who spoke.

My mother's difficult husband had put himself in charge, like an emperor crowning himself, he had decided that the decisions were this to make.

After a few weeks of steep decline, my mother lapsed into a coma. He strong heart kept right on beating while her mind was gone, and so we had no idea long she would stay like this. My mother's coma was loud and brash, full of screaming and wailing, thrashing around, wrestling and clawing. I reached a point where taking care of her was bringing me to the edge of something - increasingly fragile, I began to fray and fracture around the edges. Time had stopped, at least for me. Trapped in a nightmare, I wasn't sure I would ever leave. We stopped sleeping, taking turns to inject her with morphine every four hours. We stopped showering, leaving the house, eating, or speaking to each other, her husband and I. Always enemies, we were trapped in this strange trench together, and getting worse by the day.
And so, the decision to transfer to hospice came as a relief.

She was only there one night. I stayed with her, her incessant wailing and moaning making me wild eyed and unsure. I hadn't spoken to any other humans in days. I hadn't eaten or slept. The nurse nudged me toward a cot in the guest room upstairs. I was woken up before dawn, my mother had died. She was 63. A marathoner. A computer programmer. A hilarious, cold, indifferent, loving, thrifty, exuberant, problematic, curious mother. My mother. My only mother. The body that produced and made my body. \
\
Cold and waxy, face covered in bruises from her constant falls, I wiped the tears from my eyes. I asked the nurse to change her from her pajamas into the clothes we had picked out for her to be cremated in. I called her husband. I thanked the nurses.\
\
I walked out of the hospice in Bardowick into the small north German town, across the church cemetery and into the purple dawn. It was over.

Her husband threw the pajamas she had been wearing into the trash when he arrived.

The art of subterfuge isn't developed in a vacuum. A precipitating event is needed. I had long learned to notice what others discarded.

I took the shirt.

I burned the shirt in a ritual back in Oregon with my then partner.

We took the ashes from the fire.

I buried the ashes in the rose garden.

Some part of some part of some part of my mother is here with me - in the city she never got to visit. Never got to walk around the wooden houses and the sweet smell of summer, the plants and flowers. Never got to meet my friends, see me in a place that made sense, that gave me context she might have been able to understand and thus understand me a little better, and be a little nicer.

It's hard to feel or hear my mother. But sometimes she does call and I do listen. I go to the rose garden on her birthday in February, and on my birthday, in June, when the roses are blooming and I know she would be at her happiest. And then, I go again in December when she died, and we talk about the winter, and I ask her how she is and make sure she is OK. The winter is lonely for her, I think.\
\
Going to the rose garden and seeing the changes throughout the year gives me hope. I think of my mother and how whilst the painful parts still prick tears into my eyes, I have moved on. I can look at her now and see not only the dying body but also the mother who loved her dog and her roses and me. The roses grow up and through her, make her part of themselves. She loves more generously now she is a rose. She sees me better now, and she understands.
