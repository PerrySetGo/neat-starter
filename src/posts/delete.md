CAN IT 

TRASH IT

SCREW IT

PITCH IT

So i used to keep kind of everything - like, emails, photos, docs, music. Immaterial and material. I had weird tastes even then so i collected sort of mercilessly. Especially music, and weird snippets of videos taped off the TV. I thought I might make art some day, or a kinda video collage or something like that. I made oddball art out of garbage and had strange fashions that were sort of assembled. I owned a lot of crap!

(The official term for this is bricolage.)

The older I get, the more ruthless I become. With myself, with people, with circumstances, but above all, with keeping things. I love the cold, clear feeling of deletion. I love that moment of dissolving and not-being-able-to-bring-it-back-oh-well-fuck-it.

Every time I meet someone who hangs on to things more, I feel glad that I don't care that much. Everytime I meet someone who pitches things with even more reckless abandon than I do, I take a big inhale of their freedom and I thank them for allowing me to shave even closer, to move on faster, to relinquish sooner, to get down to what really matters.

its hard to let go of feelings, its hard to get go of people. But there is something...so ego driven about the art of trying to keep materials present that its almost as if you get to practice on emails and photos to let people just be themselves, including allowing them to remove themselves from your life if they want. I don't mean to say "throw people away". No, not at all - but you can't hold any of it, not really, not for good. The illusion of control exists for items, the illusion of control exists for ideas and for people.

The less external "stuff" including giant folders of documents I need, the less i have archives and archives of "projects" I'm not actually working on, the more readily admit that I am likely never going to be working on these things, the more I'm just present in this here and now, the lighter and manageable I feel.
