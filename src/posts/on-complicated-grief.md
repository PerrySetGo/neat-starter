Before my mother died I didn't know much about grief.\
She died of cancer 6 years ago and I took care of her as she was dying.

I had and have a tricky relationship with missing things and people, still, and grieving is related to missing. It's noticing absence and then finding a way to do something, or, at the very least, express those feelings.

But I didn't really know real grief, and I definitely didn't know grief that has the complexity that this grief has. It's the sixth anniversary of my mum's passing today. The grief i feel is not just about her passing, my missing of her, my wishing she were still living her life. It is a deep and angry indictment of certain aspects of her life and her relationships. It is a upset and angry, almost choking feeling at the circumstances of her death, which, included so much failure of both the systemic and the personal kind.

My grief is not a sad and solemn field of wheat, or a lonely tree, or a bouquet of flowers. It is not a white card. It is not a flat surface. If my grief were a rock, it would be a brittle, sharp piece of slate, crumbling at the edges but never actually getting smaller. If it were a dream, it would be the loony, sweaty nightmare that has you sitting bolt upright in bed, grasping at every thought that clarifies that that never happened, except in my case, it did. It is rich, dark, and ferocious, not like melted chocolate, but like tar, covering up every feature, smoking, a stench. It is deeply sad, like a long, damp tunnel with no lights on. It is being crawled on my insects  that originate out of nowhere. \

The grief doesn't get less complicated as time passes, actually. It gets - a little more predictable, a little more known, a little more accessible. But not smaller.

I have many things I wish were different about this death, this grief.

I wish I could say it is OK to feel grief. I'm still not sure I can - I feel calmer than back then, when I had to remove myself from the grief support group, as I was being toxic for other people over the how, the where, the who, but OK is not how I would describe myself. I wish I could say that I have made peace. I haven't. I have tried, I have not succeeded. I wish I could say that someday it gets easier. So far that day has not come. It is very, very very lonely. 

I wanted my mum to have a better death.\
I wanted me to have a better experience of providing support to her as she died.\
I wanted to have and keep people in my life who knew my mother and would remember her death right along with me, to share in that grief.\
None of these have things have happened.

With complicated grief, the death part, the dying and then dead person - at least in my experience - starts to fade away. People die, all day long. But its our expectations of life and dying that also dies right along with them. Complicated grief about dying becomes complicated feelings about now, about living, about how things could have been different. As we move through time, we have less and less connection to what happened as a process, only the sharpest shards remain.
