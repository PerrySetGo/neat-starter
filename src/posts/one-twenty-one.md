I wrote this thread on twitter today, here it is as a post.

Happy 121th day of not-mourning to you.\
I almost died 4 months ago today.\
Love you, mean it.\
Wear a helmet.

❤️

It's 9:43 pm here - about now i was waking up from 6 hours of surgery on christmas eve. I lost a lot of blood and nobody knew who I was for a while so I just had the anonymous name the system assigned to me.

I had managed to squeeze out the name of my therapist (yay therapy, truly a life saver) and the hospital social worker googled her name and called. It being christmas, she was with family down in California, but against all odds saw a voicemail light up on her phone.

My therapist ID'd me to the hospital, and they put her through to the ICU, shoved a phone in my face. she told me how I was hit by a car, and I was badly hurt, and was going to be OK. I was intubated, tied to a bed, with my glasses smashed in the crash so i couldn't see anything.

I lot happened in the following days and weeks that I don't really remember.\
But only just heard from my therapist that she was prepared to fly back to Portland if she hadn't been able to raise someone for me, so I wouldn't have to be going through this alone.

Since the accident there have been many moments of deep love and affection shown to me through friends old and new. Colleagues, doctors, nurses, therapists, my family, the internet, strangers, and former lovers.

In two months it's going to be another big anniversary -\
Having a birthday on June 23rd\
And close call with death on December 24th\
Means that the day after my birthday this year is the day I'd nearly be gone six months.

That feels fairly fucking significant by any stretch.

I've decided to stop talking about my accident quite so much until then.\
I'm going to continue healing quietly and in the closer scope of my friends.\
Not because I feel like I have nothing to say about being hurt,\
But because I don't know what I have to say about being alive yet.

After such a close call, I keep reiterating to myself:\
What if you had died that day?\
Who would be reading my journals right now?\
Would they pass on the messages to you I kept to yourself?\
What about the ideas and visions I have never clarified?

I want to spend my time not measuring the distance I'm gaining from this close call, and from the long list of severe injuries I sustained. But instead working telling the people and the stories I want to be sharing.\
From doing the work I've been putting off.

From saying "later", and "when I have time", and others, so familiar. Tick tock, tick tock.\
It seems like the wrong decision to return to the same way of thinking and doing as before.\
It's time to make precise choices about what I do with this time.

If you've read any of my injury tweets or threads you know how grateful I am, and always will be, for the vital, sustaining energy you gave me when things were dire. the cards, the supplies bought off my wishlist, the DMs, the text messages, the letters, the plants and flowers.

The steady nonstop stream of visitors, the clothes and supplies you brought me, the meals, cooked and bought, the video calls and hospital runs. Storing my stuff and helping re-arrange when I couldn't reach from my wheelchair, coming to my New Year's Eve re-do in March.

I owe you. I owe you more of myself, because you think that I am strong -- I am so much stronger. You think I am creative and funny, good with words - I am better than I have ever expressed. You think I care about the causes I lend myself towards. I care more than I have shared.

I owe yourself and myself to be more myself than ever before.\
Injury update in june. But until then, work, play, focus, concentration, music. Maybe I'll even get to go on a date or two here eventually, who knows. \
Thanks for everything.\
I couldn't have done it without you.
