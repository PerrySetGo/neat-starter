I made a decision several months ago that was way overdue.

And then I started talking about it - and I'm writing this because I expect to keep talking about it in different ways basically for the rest of my life.

I've come out several times in my life - as a lesbian, when I was 16. As a queer gender non-conforming/non-binary trans-ish person (the label keep changing) in my early 20's. And now, I'm coming out again as someone who is done with monogamous relationships for good. 

The decision I made was to commit myself (even if this meant excluding future dates) to non-monogamy as the framework through with I would seek and live my relationships. And here are some thoughts about it.

let's start with what I'm not before we talk about what I am.

## What I'm Not

* Currently in a relationship
* Immune to jealousy
* In my 20's and trying to be queer and hip
* Jaded and emotionally unavailable, or trying to avoid intimacy or attachment or commitment
* Trying to rack up as many dates as possible
* Deciding this as a reaction to my divorce
* A cheater (see below for details on this *)

## What I am

* Divorced (my marriage was monogamous, as were other relationships)
* Focused on me, at the moment - but also affectionate, loyal, curious, protective
* Someone who is happiest when they have a lot of independence and space
* A person with, generally speaking, secure attachment patterns (sometimes with some preoccupied features)
* A Bit of a Slut and OK With That

## A Not So Brief History

Some people come to non-monogamy by being in a relationship that they decide to open up to sexual and/or romantic encounters with people outside of the relationship, but that hasn't been my path.

I didn't have much exposure to non-traditional relationship styles, until I met someone who was in a primary relationship with another person in my early 20's. As with many queers, I experimented with polyamory as part of a deeper exploration into queer identity. There was some jealousy and some difficulty, but it feels challenging to separate those feelings from the messed up dynamics, lies (and now obvious to me personality disorder) that this ex was clearly dealing with, but the fact that she was in an open relationship was not that high on the list of messed up things that were going on.

But moving forward into different relationships I didn't take an active stance in claiming "poly" as a label for myself - I dated exclusively and non-exclusively in a fairly chaotic way for several years until my mid/late 20's, when I entered into my first long term relationship in some time. At the time we had a strong undercurrent of kink and experimentation in our relationship, as my ex identified as a masochist and bottom, but after some first conversations about staying open we drifted into a closed relationship. We were not right for each other in many ways, but have remained friends.

I had a lot of work to do on myself after that relationship ended - but repeated the same haphazard dating style than before for a while. I slept/dated around, some momo people, some poly, some hookups, some steady dates for a few months here and there that then ended with a disaster. Some people who I still think fondly of, some who I have a neutral connection to, and some of which who brought me tremendous pain. I dated someone during this time who, along with my first poly-partner, was one of the most toxic, abusive and manipulative people I have had the misfortune to let into my life. Is clear to me that I was wrapped up in the machinations of a narcissistic sociopath in a way that was, and sometimes is, deeply damaging - those two people are where a lot of my trauma comes from, that I then found hard to deal with when I saw traces of it in other people.

A few years or so before I met my now-ex wife, I committed myself to a period of celibacy and self-growth in a different way. I buried myself in self-help books and committed myself to weekly therapy. I began investigating my thoughts, feelings, patterns and experiences around relationships. I grew and learned a ton. I started dealing with my trauma, my anger, my triggers, my experiences with PTSD. I started dating more healthily and with greater empathy for both myself and overs, but I still did not really get honest with myself around what I wanted, and what I knew had caused my previous relationship to fail.

When I met my ex, we approached our relationship more intentionally than any other connection I have been in, but we still drifted into a state of monogamy and the expectation that we would spend the majority of our time focused on each other. As our relationship progressed, things got even more diffuse and enmeshed. It became more and more difficult to disentangle ourselves from the extreme closeness we had created. Things became increasingly, escalatedly controlling and her anger at my transgressions - perceived or real - became more and more inflammatory. We separated under huge duress, had a painful divorce, and are now no longer on speaking terms, which hurts me greatly.

\* I had **disclosed attractions** to other people which I never acted on. We were getting closed to discussing opening up our relationship but we hadn't. I knew as soon as our relationship ended that regardless of the fact that we had our own, specific, unique circumstances, I would be presenting a false front to any future partners if I continued to be lukewarm with them about my needs for autonomy, independence, space, and non-monogamy, amongst other things.

## Where I'm At Now

After taking a year and a half (the year was voluntary, the half was not) off from dating and relationships, I feel more at ease and aware of what I want and need in order to be the best partner I can be than ever before. Despite our difficult ending, I was a loving, supportive partner to my ex-wife through many challenging times, and know for certain what it means to commit to a relationship.

I also know that the close-knit, life-intertwined, monogamous, my-partner-is-my-default-for-everything style isn't a way I can exist happily long term. I thought I could, and probably also said I could, encouraged my ex to think I could, but I can't, and I know that now, and won't try it again, and wish I had been more honest sooner.

I'm currently exploring labels and relationship styles with people I'm dating. One that fits me well for now is _solo-poly._ Solo poly people often seem single from the outside, but they are still desiring of strong, intimate, sometimes long-standing connections with others, even though they make decisions fairly independently, generally don't live with partners, keep their finances separate, and may socialize on their own like a single person would. 

Solo poly allows me the time and space to focus on my needs, my continuing commitment to my own growth and healing, my diverse and large network of loving friends, and on my career.  My label or commitment level to people may change over time, I don't feel attached to being so unattached for forever (I would even consider getting married again, although it will be a long time, maybe never, before I live with a partner or merge finances again, it is just too stressful for me). But I will always want a greater degree of autonomy and freedom to make connections with people, including romantic/sexual ones than monogamy allows. I enjoy the highly intentional nature of good poly connections. I say good, because just because people are poly does not mean that they always employ good conversation and de-escalation techniques for difficult conversations.

Recent experiences with solo poly have taught me that everyone does it a little differently. I love there being agreements, accountability, and mutually agreed up on stuff that allows everyone to relax, and for there to be a certain amount of caretaking and attachment in a relationship, especially when there is a lot of independence. Other people don't and don't ever want to caretake. It varies. I'm still finding my people, but know that those people are excited to live in poly relationships.

## What about jealousy?

I am not a jealousy expert and there are many jealousy-inducing scenarios I haven't experienced, but I would be remiss to at least address this superficially here. I mentioned above that I do experience jealousy, after all. I do. I am working on beefing up my capacity for compersion (happiness at someone else's happiness. I'm getting much better at it with practice!) and in general I have a large capacity for love and affection. But I do sometimes get jealous, that's normal for me. That said, I consider jealousy an emotion like any other. I will probably never do kitchen-table poly where everyone knows everyone's partners and hangs out.\
\
But you also don't have to let jealousy get to control its own volume.\
\
You don't have to, in fact, shouldn't just let it run around in your life without trying to steer it, talk to it, understand it, shape it, defuse it, work with it. It's not the end of the world and people give it more power than they should.

It's less interesting for me to think about "What if I get jealous?" and more interesting to think about all the ways having to deal with jealousy is totally worth it in order to get so many of the other things that I want: Not having one person satisfy all my needs or me theirs, getting to experience different sexuality with different people, feeling love and affection from more than one person, getting to experience difference, variety, open communication, and feeling like I am being chosen. I like ALL of those things and care about them more than I am worried about jealousy and what it means, generally speaking.

I don't think that poly is better than monogamy _for everyone._ I believe that it has its pros and cons depending on who you are, what your personality is like and what your needs are from a relationship with yourself and other people. I know that by forcing myself into monogamous relationships I am making myself and others unhappy in the long run.

Knowing who I am and what makes me able to be the best partner I can be because I am making myself happy and asking for the things I need isn't selfish just because those things involve more than one person.
