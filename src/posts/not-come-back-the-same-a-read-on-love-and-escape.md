Like so many young Germans I knew, I spent my teenage years picking out parts of America, and using it to build an escape raft for myself.

I sought excitement. I wanted to be exposed to, peeled back, revealed. I’ve always been large, ambitious in my hopes, my dreams, my sacrifices, too big for my body, only recently big enough for my presence. That started somewhere. It started here. As a teen, I wrote short stories set in the mythical NYC of my mind. It didn’t matter what it was, if it came from America, we fetishized it, internalized it, made it part of ourselves. Every song on the radio in English, every show on TV a knockoff. We were trying to get away from ourselves by consuming, and escaping the tight knit expectations of the late post-war nanny state.
I wondered it what it would take to belong. I wondered where I would start to begin.

**It’s May of 2001.** I’m 20 years old, almost 21, and I’m peering out of the window of a sweltering cab on the way from LaGuardia into New York City. The streets and sounds passed by, traffic, noise, and lights. But I wasn’t alone — my girlfriend was with me. This is the story of her and I, of the city, of a moment in time, of a time, now, that history won’t let any one of us forget — how can you not think of what happened that year, at the end of the summer that had barely begun?

Afterwards, the things I brought with me all changed. Like a boomerang that returns when thrown, my life takes the reigns into its own hands, and returns, with a glint in its eye, to the place where it all began. What a coincidence.

***

I mentioned my girlfriend, V. V was an English teacher and in her early 30’s when I was 21. We’d met on an online message board, and for about a year and a half, every few weeks or so, one of us would travel the few hours each way to see each other. I lived with my mother and her new boyfriend in a boring, clinical suburb of Hamburg, where people line the trash cans up with a ruler before dawn every Wednesday, while V lived with her eccentric mother in a large, filthy, run down country house in a small town a few hundred kilometers away. We shared a love of English and American films, books and movies, and so it felt natural that for most of our relationship, we only communicated in English.

V could be stubborn, cold and aloof, but also had a ready laugh, a penchant for mischief, and didn’t care much for convention. She had short, scrubby blonde hair, and the strong, lean body of an athlete, first soccer, nearly making the German national team, before a car accident took out her ankle, and then beach volleyball (an American import as well). She loved dancing and music and Disney movies. Among her friends, she was something of an outsider, not wanting a life of built-in kitchens and holidays on the coast of Denmark. She was never interested in other’s opinions, or apologetic about her wants. And for a short time, she wanted me.

I was young then, too young to be her lover, really, now that I know the difference. The sex we had was intense, evocative, grown up. I was different, afterward. More present, but also more cunning.An outsider myself, albeit a weirder, quirkier and moodier one, I had come out at 16, and was still very much finding myself. I spent every weekend in gay bars, drunk and sometimes high, seeing a lot and doing very little. I struggled with friendships, relationships and my sense of self. V and I had little in common, but the fact that she spoke my language was enough. I felt chosen, and maybe a little bit understood.

And so after dating for about a year, we booked a flight, picked out the cheapest room we could find, and went to New York.

For ten days we walked around with our mouths open — inhaling the city, letting it settle on our skin, into our hair. Absorbing. Noticing. Comparing. It was all so different: The people, the fashion, the smells, the sounds. Mystified by the subway, scared of buses and too broke for cabs, we walked for hours up and down city streets, breathing in snatches of music, fragments of conversation. Checking everything we saw against those memories that movies, tv, magazines and music had imprinted on us.

We had a private room in a hostel in Chelsea. It was so small you couldn’t close the door with the suitcase not under the bed. There was no closet, just a wire hanger on the back of the door, a bare bulb in the fixture above the bed. Sometimes, the light would flicker, while the smell of food crept in at odd hours. Beyond the barred window there was no view, just a wall. V grumbled, but I didn’t care. The room suited me fine in my strange state: A current ran through my body. I felt alive, and sometimes in a kind of rage that I could feel rising up in my veins. The bars didn’t stop the noise came through that very window, taxis, danger, cops and garbage, and I didn’t care, drown it out, drown me out, because my body in America had things to say and questions to ask of myself and of V.

We dealt with the heat by rising early, walking with clean sidewalks in the mornings, commuters, dogs, coffee, and the smell of fresh cut grass. We took photos: The flatiron, synagogues, reflections in the mirrored glass of buildings. Kids playing in the park. Colorful chalk drawings on brick walls. The Empire State Building. The John Lennon Memorial. The World Trade Center, which I remember stabbing up into the sky like a huge tuning fork.

Once, with a fake ID, I insisted we go to a gay bar, where against all expectations, I was let in. I ordered expensive drinks I’d heard of on tv, while V scoffed underneath her breath and we argued on the way home. About what, I can no longer say.

Mid way through our trip, something had begun to change. We’d fight, and I didn’t understand myself or the world: I felt stupid and young and confused, but she seemed to calmly understand everything, and didn’t care about most of it. She acted uncaring and hurtful when she knew it affected me the most. I never knew what she would say or do next, leaving me anxious and unsure. I grimaced at the cheesy New York sweatshirt she had picked up, not wanting to seem like such a tourist, while she scoffed at me trying to pass and fit in. I felt like I was falling out of love already, but I kept trying to see her through the noise.

When I really looked, I’d always see her strong shoulders and the beginning of a few fine lines around her eyes and mouth. I loved those lines, those shoulders, above me, her laughter, her directness, her strength. What did she love about me? I don’t know now, and I didn’t know then. But the way I felt held in her arms, how right that felt, allowing me to settle into place in a way that still feels important. V’s cool irritation with other people’s needs gave me early wounds, it hurt when she picked fights and forgot my birthday. But her self acceptance, and her impatience with rules and roles challenged my preconceived notions of how I could be with someone. This unwitting exploration started somewhere. It started here, with V, who hated being boxed in, and laughed in the face of expectations.

“Do you want to go up to the observation deck?”, I asked, looking up, seemingly forever. It was a cold, breezy day, and wind was scattering leaves across the plaza, the future home of Ground Zero. A cemetery for more than just the people who died there. There was no way we could have known, how anyone could have known what was going to happen just a few months later. And when it did happen, I couldn’t forget just how much sky those towers blocked out.

“No,” V said, lounging on the plaza in front of the World Trade Center, her long legs stretched out, smoking a cigarette and eating a sandwich. She was bored, and feeling pretty done with New York. “It’s too expensive. We can do that next time we’re here.”
I should have known, then, that one way or the other, we’d never return.
Things quickly fell apart after we got back to Germany. Friends and new interests drew me away from V. I started changing, quickly, while V mostly stayed the same, living in her mother’s basement, being grumpy on the phone, finding fault in everything. As the towers crumbled on 9/11, we had already separated, but that didn’t stop memories of our trip being forced up for both of us.
I did move to the States. But not right away, in fact, it took 4 more years. And when it did, I didn’t move to New York. I moved to Portland, the other side of the country, to be with someone, who it turns out, had no idea who I was either.
Over the next 13 years, I went through so much, from death of a parent to fighting for my immigration status, from winning scholarships to ivy league colleges to periods of homelessness. From random hookups, to falling in love and getting married. I changed my name, changed my gender, and changed my citizenship.
I didn’t come back to New York.

I don’t know if V did. She is still a traveller, and also a writer, who published a novel, written in English. We’re not in touch, but she has a website, and on it, a blog. By the looks of it, she’s barely changed, cocky grin crossing her face, the face that looks exactly the same.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kU4UAmSYtYx76ots6stfQLVTsjmEblxoVuPmfpj3lUMi4OUYM4KMZNhjv54sk8a0igE-GT9Z76woxHjpVb3E9AxjxprcdgkmAdmGP5yM9yd8DFFr2YDiyldfcxFYDrPpCq_lMKjU)


I thought about the lines on that face sometimes, and how when I looked at her, I knew, for the first time, without hesitation, that I was queer. Queer as the sea. Queer as a pink sunset. Queer as rocks and stones and edges that don’t quite fit together. Queer as queens in the city. Queer as in a friend who isn’t what you expected. Queer as so many things that don’t really stand out, but are still remarkable in their own way.
I think about how I’ve long since forgiven her for being imperfect. I see her shoulders on others and love them. I see her lines on others and wonder how they got there.

Sometimes beauty is the opposite of wonder, and sometimes it is the same.

And here we are. In the last few months, I turned my life upside down and shook it out. I spent more than half a decade married to someone very different from V, who meant everything to me, but again I’m not sure: ****I know why I loved you, but why did you love me?

As that relationship fades into something different, I decide to travel, again. I get on a plane. The rhythm of travel underpins my life, bringing old truths forward. I go to New York for the first time in 16 years — for a conference.
I’m in Midtown, in a grim AirBnb with peeling paint, where food smells filter underneath the door and the view is actually quite beautiful. There is a closet but no hangers, and the lighting is just as bad. There is more than enough space for a suitcase, but there is no lover. I’m not here with anyone. I’m alone, and at a turning point. I have decisions to make.

I’m stronger than I ever have been, more acutely in tune with who I am. I’ve been handed a stack of my own decisions, not all of them good. My blood rises just like it did last time. Even the rain can’t cool my tense, burning thoughts. Less wide eyed, more wide-hearted, but I feel wild, still.
I walk around inhaling the city like I did, comparing memory to memory. Who was I, then? Who am I, now? Was the excitement I felt an illusion? Do I still have time to feel it again? I think of shoulders and hands on a person I know. When she looks at me, she struggles a little bit to hold my gaze. The same fierce attraction lingers. What does she see?

I think of myself, when I married the person I will always love but cannot live with. I think of others for whom I was once a chance, a great opportunity, a revelation, a decision, a risk, an investment, a choice, a compromise, a mistake.
It’s time to wake up. It’s time for everything to change, again. To do and undo. To challenge my capacity for love and regrowth. A small person, I am large, still, in ambition, hope, and desire. I have a lot more left to give. And I really, really want myself. And I want, and need, to know who I am, and what I’m capable of, and why I am loved.

Next time, I’ll know who loves me and why, even if the only one I’m with is myself.
