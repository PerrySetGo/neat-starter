So a week ago today I had a date that went awry, and then the next day I broke up with the person I had been dating for two months. After connecting online we had a fabulous first date - an intense chemistry.

We'd see each other 1-2 times a week, but stayed in touch almost every day - sharing music, sometimes photos, jokes, stories, information about our day, including while I was gone abroad for a few weeks. We were both dating other people and being pretty intentional about our communication.

But the trip to europe really knocked the wind out of my sails - I came back feeling physically wiped out and dealing with something that felt (and feels) more existential: I sense of drifting unproductivity. I sense of alienation, underlying melancholy and dread. I had been feeling depressed, unfocused, troubled. I was also in physical pain and dealing with a severe cold. I managed to shake these feelings off for our first date after I got back, for the most part, but the next day after our sleepover my heavy feelings returned. I felt annoyed, grim, fragmented, distractable, lost. Old memories of people who had once been sharp, dangerous influences in my life kept resurfacing. 

Before I headed over to her house I felt a slight sense of trepidation I couldn't quite put my finger on, and waved away. But as I arrived at her house it seemed obvious that I wasn't able to connect - our plan involved getting out of the house and going for a soak, but we didn't get that far - she sensed something was wrong, and made it clear that she only really wanted to hang out with me if I was able to get over what was bothering me and connect with her, and in the case that I couldn't, I could leave. I think the intention was to encourage me to take care of myself, but that's not how it felt to me.

That hit me harder than I expected. I felt like I was being punished or shamed, and nothing she could say was making it better. I was embarassed to not have my emotions in check, I felt misjudged and not given an opportunity to arrive. I left abruptly, feeling humiliated and somewhat activated - she had tapped into a piece of me psyche I've been working with a lot lately. I'm working/rewriting so much around articulating my needs. My need in this situation was to go soak and have a chance to come around, and have it be OK for me to not be perfect and chipper all the time. I didn't get that chance. I walked off, very upset. I apologized via a video message for my abrupt departure, and didn't hear anything back from her for the rest of the night.

I spent the night and the next day thinking through what had happened here from my point of view - without wanting to, the scenario around suggesting I leave had felt similar enough to a challenging pattern that had developed in my marriage. I was pleased to understand emotionally what had happened here, as even I was surprised at my strong reaction.

When we met on Saturday evening to talk all this over, I was well prepared, and had thought everything through. I was nervous to share highly vulnerable details of some of my more difficult aspects openly, but at the same time oddly looking forward to it. I was expecting a calm conversation. I felt hopeful we could put this behind us, and come away with a greater understanding of who we were and what had happened.

As soon as I arrived - she was agitated, defensive, telling me she expected me to tell her all the ways and things she had done wrong. I tried to say what I came prepared to say - sharing some difficult information about myself. But she couldn't process anything I said - instead she just hurled back at me that I was the common denominator that linked the trauma I had experienced. She accused me of projecting on to her in several different ways, and transferring my negative relationship patterns onto her and us. She angrily rebuked me, after I had disclosed to her that anger was triggering for me, and then walked away. As the conversation escalated into sneering on text, I ended things, on the spot, via text message.

Since then I haven't been able to put behind me how sad and upset and angry this makes me feel.

There are so many things here I wish that had happened differently, but as I ran through this sequence of events over and over in my mind, I realized that I saw important parallels between these challenging moments and other relationships I have had in the past.

What is different is that I so clearly and decisively ended things as quickly and as resolutely as I did. 

I miss her a lot - I was definitely developing feelings for and had plans and ideas for the immediate future. 

My needs when conflict arises are very different than hers, and maybe many people - I will not engage in harsh, hostile feeling, loud, intense verbal conflict, especially not with accusations and punitive shaming. Having her get so angry at me (after I disclosed the damaging effect shame and anger has had on me) so soon in our relationship felt like a big red flag. My expectations in terms of what I expect from a date have shifted into a space where I need to know that even in an angry or tense situation, we will hear each other, communicate calmly, refrain from exaggerations and accusations. Strong opinions expressed carefully are fine. But I need to be able to both ask for and receive good care when conflict comes up. 

I'm very glad to have learned this lesson. And it feels like I learned it for good. From now on, I will make "understanding who/how you are when there is conflict" an essential part of my getting-to-know-you and figuring out if we can be longer term partners if that is what we want.

I am sad, I am a little heartbroken, but I also know that this is the better decision for both of us in the long run - clearly we need different things. She needs someone who can accept her outbursts and hard boundaries and still make her feel safe and cared for, and I need someone who makes sure I feel safe and cared for by not having outbursts or insisting on exclusionary feeling boundaries, and making sure communication happens on an emotional level that feels safe for me.
