careful, soft and bright - 

those were the first words thought. Up until a moment before, there was a one thing, then, after tender movement, another. it wasn't quite as expected, lighter, maybe, but with a soft tugging undertow of a lip, placed, squarely, lingeringly, pressing: the entrance to a novel, but only the first chapter, a slippery, gentle knot until a place opened up beneath the surface, and the undertow grew, greater, hastier, broader and more confusing, now longer tugging, but asking. strong, thick, and demanding, as the tone changed, no longer just lip but mouth, the inside, coiling and recoiling, like an urgent basket of rope, like a pan full of churning water, pulling now from the inside and turning into the outside, as broad as possible, wide, fervent, open, like an endangered thread, like a forest of chopped wood, like an open beach, like a fast wave running up the beach onto the hot, salted sand, followed by a staggered beating of waves across jagged rocks, into the very corners of a mouth that ceased to be just a mouth. the words continued silently, the seam ripped and ripped, lost, lip to lip, top to bottom, face to cunt.
