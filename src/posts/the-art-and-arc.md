I have been thinking about tension a lot lately.

Not just any kind of tension - specifically, erotic / sexual tension. (there may be a difference between sexual and erotic tension, i'm not sure yet.) And even more specifically how, we as interacting humans, create, sustain, shut down, begin, engage, perform and withdraw opportunities for erotic tension and buildup.

I've come to realize that there is a huge amount of...skill, energy, and, yes, artistry that goes into process of seducing the other. And I don't mean seduction in a sleazy, eyebrow-waggling "the moves" kind of way. I mean intentionally creating an interactional space, a dynamic, an...i wish I had a slightly less martial word - an arena in which we intentionally create opportunities to engage erotically, seductively, sensually - or just get to know each other more.

Let me explain by using an example of another kind of arena.

**Two people get together at a restaurant.** They study the menu. They consider the ingredients, the way things are prepared. The temperature outside. The weather. It's hot - time for something fresh and light. Its cold - time for something warm and nourishing. What they are wearing - who eats soup when they are wearing white? What they are going to do after. Something athletic?  Sex? Or cozy - tv on the couch? They consider dietary needs. They consider their budgets, what they ate previously already this week, whether this is the first time either of them has been to this restaurant. What time it is. What the occasion is. They look at reviews, what other people are eating. They choose drinks to accompany the meal. And so on.\
\
**And they also consider each other.** Watching each other eating, contemplating each other's hands, mouths, laughter, eye contact, manners, technique, whether their dining companion has cilantro on their teeth or sauce on their chin. Eating something seductively - in fact, eating in of itself, nourishing, tending to the body's needs is analogous with sexual desire. Wanting food, having an appetite for something is the earliest way we tune into having needs that can only be sated by something external, consumable.

If this is a meal that is clearly part of a date that is supposed to lead to greater intimacy and sex, then it's likely that the restaurant was chosen carefully and with this in mind. They consider each other's appetites, desires, personalities. They are eating to learn about each other. They consider the experience for each other. They are, ideally, equally invested in each other's pleasure, regardless of whether they are eating the same thing. They both want each other to experience something special. They ask each other "how is your food?" If they picked a bad restaurant, they'll commiserate over that choice. They may even write a yelp review together after the fact.

Compare that to ordering - dunno, postmates or something. One is about nourishment. One is about the experience of the food - but also of each other.

There is a bounded interactional arena here. Some walls contain the space: Culinary expectations (we eat certain foods with our hands, some meals are considered more "romantic" than others), but otherwise, it's for the two people in question to consider each other's needs and create...a tableau that is not just nutritionally nourishing, but, if that's then their goal, seductive, inviting, erotically nourishing. There is a back and forth. It's play. 

In reality all moments where humans connect contain moments of these energetic exchanges, it's just that the restaurant example is a really accessible one, i think. I am finding that - every point of interaction contains the potential for a really vibrant exchange. 

Complimenting someone (in a way that invites further compliments and engagement). Inviting someone (and telling them why their presence is desirable.) Do only the first half of these things and there isn't much of a way to keep moving forward.

This is what flirting is, I think. I think. It's intentionally engaging in an interactional arena that has, as its goal, to deliver pleasure and excitement to both (or potentially more) people involved.

I feel like my emphasis on this is a direct consequence of the broader efforts in healing. It has meant stating my needs more clearly, but also taking more risks and being more forward, and asking for people to step up and step in to my zone more. It has meant re-learning how to trust my instincts and feel comfortable owning my choices. I'm learning a lot about how passivity is also a form of expectation. 

It has also brought me closer to the ways where I have, in the past, made others shoulder the majority of the burden in terms of creating really vibrant and rewarding experiences, both sexually and otherwise. I have, at times, been very passive and rote for fear of being rejected or ridiculed. In stepping up and into my own desire more, I am not only gently rejecting the idea only one person in that dynamic is actually responsible for anything, but I also undertaking a thoughtful revamp of my own approaches, what I, historically have offered, done, engaged, considered. It has made me a better lover, and a more compelling and rewarding person to be around. I look forward to exploring how it continues to shape and change interactions and dynamics I develop with other people.
