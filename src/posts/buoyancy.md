"To live in this world is to experience loss. Grief is another side of the love that animates the universe." -- Power from the Edges: An exploration of magic to support justice workers, Charlie Stang

It's not how far you fall, it's how buoyant you are, that is, how quickly you surface. I'm not sure how to tell you, what to learn, how to be, how to walk. But I am sure that if you live long enough, someday, grief will come. And if you live through that, it'll come again. And again. And again.

And someday you'll develop a sense of your own buoyancy, namely, how quickly you can move through deep emotion and up from a dark place into a lighter, more fluent sense of self.

Being buoyant doesn't mean pain is cheap. It also doesn't mean that you run from darkness. It means, most crucially, that you accept your emotions and the world as they are. Up/Down. Lose/Find. Give/Receive.

Being buoyant and accepting the high with the low means you are ready to accept that neither the avoidance of depth nor the wallowing in it is "the truth." It means you accept that you tell your story of pain to one person, who shrugs it off, and to another, to whom it is the worst thing they have heard in a while. It means you accept your own shifting and changing. It means that you can play all the notes on the scale.

I used to believe only the dark painful emotions were true, and that happiness was an illusion conjured up by stupidity to confuse the weak.

That's not true and is more about being in pain and being blocked than it is about "truth".

Instead, knowing that I can be all things, shimmering through to others, layered, all true, all untrue, all sinking, all rising, all at the same time...buoyancy. Staying afloat. Even if you can't say exactly why you are needed, believe your feelings. Things came together to produce you. You are far from an accident. Rejoice in your own depth. Being in pain is as much a sign of being alive is laughing out loud.

Celebrate both.
