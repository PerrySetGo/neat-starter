I started a new blog. This has happened many times. But this time is new.

This time I'm going to tell it however i feel and let it just be what it is.

I'm not sure how many blogs and personal websites I've had over the last 20 odd years of building websites - maybe 10? maybe 15?

and you know what is funny about that - I don't think more than 2-3 of them were actually built on the same stack, every time it was like: "I'm going to learn this brand new technology and build this awesome new site oh wait this is kinda complicated ugh well i guess at least i got it online, oh dear now i don't have the energy to actually maintain it wait how does this work again oh well just let it die".

I'm intentionally doing not-that. i'm just trying to get thoughts down. i have a lot to fucking say. maybe keeping it simple will mean that i actually add content. i think i will. I feel cautiously optimistic about this one. I'm in a good place to be  learning more about doing things consistently.
