I can't claim to be profound. That may happen (even though it's not intentional), but most of the time, I've I portray my feelings halfway accurately and can provide someone some comfort with something I say and how I say it, then I'm happy. I'm not sure today is going to be one of those days.

Everything feels colossally stupid today - like walking around and realizing, hours later, that your zipper is down or your tshirt inside out. Stupid like dropping something you spent hours baking or making on the floor. Stupid like eating too much chocolate. Stupid like sleeping with someone you are not attracted to.

Stupid like it's not supposed to be like this, stupid like annoying, wrong, and feeling like "this is not my life". Stupid like caring about someone who clearly isn't worth it. Stupid like being made fun of because of your hair, your clothes, your voice.

None of those things happened today (although they have all happened to me in my life more than once, a stupid amount of times, maybe).

What happened today is that I waited for a call to come and it didn't come and so I didn't get to make the decision I've been waiting for.

I'm upset.

I'm angry. 

I'm aggravated.

I'm sad.

I'm stuck.

I'm afraid.

I knew that when my bones started hurting like they did 4 months ago (more, actually) this was a bad sign. I knew there wouldn't be simple solutions. And so, when I looked at my hands today and saw them looking older than they have lately, and realized that time is moving, moving on, and the phone call didn't come today, I started hiding. Because that's what you do when you're me and you're scared and you don't know what's next.

It's October. 

In two weeks I'll be 10 months out from the accident that changed - absolutely everything for me. And the call I was waiting for today is about maybe needing another abdominal/pelvic and potentially also spine surgery. 

This means (the below is sort of a worst case scenario, I acknowledge that), admittance to hospital, intubation, general sedation, being cut open, xrayed from the inside (through my vagina), bolted together through my spine and also lower pelvis, potential damage to my bladder (it got torn last time), internal staples, stitches, drains, scars, hospital for a week, opiates, bedpans, not being able to move my legs or lower body, needing to be carried onto the commode to pee and poop, having someone else wipe my ass, a catheter, bedrest, touch down weight bearing with a walker, physical and occupational therapy, potentially in home, shit tons of pain medication, rehab - 3 x gravy a day, evangelical radio, loud beeping noises, sweaty pillows, no sleep, wheelchairs, bath benches, canes, reachers, sock aide's, xrays every few weeks

and if I'm lucky, after 2-4 months, i'll be walking again. There will be a bunch more scars. I may still never run or hike a mountain ever again. 

It may not be that bad.

It may not.

It likely won't.

But i just don't know, you know?\
Today the phone call telling me what the surgical plan is didn't come.

An emergency, the care team told me. That's alright. I am not an emergency.

What feels like an emergency is that I want - my life back. My skin back. My body back. My decisions back.

I dont recognize myself some days. I hurt, I am weak, I want to do nothing but sleep, I'm not giving up but I don't know how to keep going. I'm in pain, all the time, every day, things that were easy are now hard, I force myself to move around and clean and do but I don't know what to do next.

I fight. I fight the voices that tell me to give up. I fight the voice that tells me this is miy fault. I fight the feeling that this is all there is. I fight. I fight. And sometimes fighting is very lonely. And sometimes fighting doesn't make any sense. And sometimes fighting is just so fucking stupid, to stupid to understand, to stupid to fucking ever understand.
