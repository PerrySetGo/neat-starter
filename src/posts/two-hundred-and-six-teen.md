216 hours is nine days. Today is November the 13th, and so 9 days puts us on November 22nd.

It's been a long time since i have posted an update - the words sort of got stuck in me for a while, as they do, sometimes, when a lot is happening, or nothing is happening, or a waiting is happening, or lots of other writing is happening, words for myself about myself can get stuck and not come. And they aren't really here yet right now but I am forcing them out.

On November 22nd, which is a Friday, I'm going to go under and have surgery again - on my pelvis, yes. The fracture isn't healing well. It's healing, but not with bone in the faultlines of the large fracture, instead, its healing with fibrous cartilage as there is too much movement in the fracture - mostly this is because the hardware failed and started breaking. Why did the hardware start failing? Because there was too much movement. Why was there too much movement? Well, because I was moving "too much". Why was I moving too much? Well - because I'm me, but also, maybe, because there was too much movement in the fracture and the fixation wasn't strong enough and who cares.

I've actually been in quite a bit less pain this last week or two than I was 6 weeks ago when I went in to my doctor's on a fairly urgent basis, and we ran two sets of xrays and an mri and a ct and a nerve study.

Surgery is long, daunting and complicated. Its three surgeries



I'm in a lot less pain but my movement still stucks, I get tired so fast, I limp, I hobble, I get sore pain and stabbing pain and dull achy pain and needle-like pain and tendon pain. The center, literally, cannot hold.

And so here I am.

It all feels like very much a lot all the time. But I don't know what else to do apart from face it?

I am waiting, constantly. waiting. waiting for the doctors who are supposedly going to contact me with a second opinion to come through (I have been waiting for 2 1/2 weeks for this now), waiting for the surgery, waiting, waiting, waiting. I'll wait again to see if they can do the surgery in one go, or, whether they have to split it up, and wait inbetween. I will wait after it is complete, to see if  my bladder got damaged, again, to see if the pudendal nerve to my clit got torn and I won't feel much during sex moving forward, to see if I have drop foot and I'll never run again. I'll wait months to see whether or not this operation improves my pain, my mobility, my life. I wait, wait, wait, as if I haven't waited so long already, waited my whole life to finally be all right, waiting for the doctor to see me now. And, also, waiting, waiting to see if I die or not die on that operating table, because people die during routine operations sometimes, this happens. Will I know? If I'm sedated? Or will I just wait and then be dead? I'm guessing that I probably won't know and I'll die waiting, of a sort.

What else is there?

There is a lot, really, there is A Person, and a job, and decisions are being made, and I'm still here managing to laugh at least once most days. Some days are very dark. Some days are light.

9 days left.
