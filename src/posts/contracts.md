letting in new people is hard.

it feels hard generally but it also feels hard currently, specifically.

i am thinking through how all this feels and the only conclusion I can come to is that for me, when you live through a really difficult time, and you have friends and supporters who carry you through that time, it is difficult to connect with people who don't experience that with you. Who weren't there from the beginning.

It feels disingenuous to not talk about all that has been hard.

It feels abbreviating, not emotionally honest. It requires a ton of...emotional labour and work to adequately present the past. At the same time, trying to take someone in who has just been through A Thing, or, in my case A Fucking Nightmarish Hellscape of 18 Months Of Things, and A Great Deal Of Trauma Before That is...it's hard and I see that it is hard. 

Seal a person in the past? Not great.\
Tell them they need to get over it and move on? Also not great.

Receiving a damaged person correctly is a big responsibility.

Where is there room here. Where is there space to navigate what feels like another set of traps.

I am done feeling so trapped. So locked in to stories and circumstances. This time of year is always so hard because it is the anniversary of big awful things, and also profound change. It's a big old ball of energy and history that can't seem to be ever resolved. My diaries from the last however long, many years, point to these weeks prior to my birthday as a time of deep insecurity, vulnerability, sadness, and damage.

I wrote about this already yesterday and it continues today.

I am grieving for the person that once had no associations beyond excitement for pride and their birthday and now has a hard time staying in their skin or their feelings because of what happened, many years ago, and then some other things, and then some other things, all around the same time of year.

I feel the old ache of anxiety around disclosure and also a deep desire to be heard, seen and believed crack open. It's so painful to be trapped between wanting to tell but also deeply fearing the exposure and punishment and loss that seems inevitable to me from disclosing these deep wounds, and the shame that I still sometimes feel linger.
