It's been a while. I feel like a lot has happened - the last few posts I made I was musing about dating someone, then I dated someone for two months and that just ended.

It didn't end well. I was talking about this to my therapist the other day who told me something useful:

Just because we realize we want to make different decisions and meet different kinds of people, that doesn't mean that just happens automatically. We often still meet the same kinds of people for a while and that is where we get to test the different kinds of decisions we make.

This post isn't really supposed to be about that. Maybe I'll write more about that topic in a later post. First of all I want to write a little about work and how I'm struggling to create accountability and structure for myself and what I am doing about it.

I love where I work. This isn't a tech blog, but instead it's a thought playground where I get to post random stuff that probably nobody really sees. But I do have a job I enjoy for a company I value, creating something that is meaningful for other people. I run a support forum for a software company and do other community building work. We don't do anything evil, I love my colleagues, I am respected and paid well, and I want to work for my employer for a long time.

But the truth is I am still - philosophically, emotionally, capacity-wise, energetically, and on other levels too - recovering.

I'm recovering from my divorce, which shook up the stability and structure of the last few years. I am recovering from a serious accident. I am recovering from made many big decisions and grown exponentially over the last 18-20 months. In many ways, things feel temporary. I keep saying things like "when I am finished with this" "soon" "i'll get to that" and "i am too busy right now" but am not being as productive or as focused as I would like.

I'm not trying to overwork myself - having a clear balance between the job (that pays) the work (the cause that fulfills) and other areas of my life is super important. But if I'm being really honest I'm doing a lot of wishful thinking and not enough planning and actualizing lately in almost all areas of my life.

I'm OK with that in some ways - as I mentioned, I'm recovering. But I'm also driven by a strong sense of wanting to use my time wisely. If I am relaxing, I want to feel like I am really relaxing, not just not-working or thinking I should be working. Without greater structure to my efforts I feel a bit suspended between things, without much to push against. I haven't been writing (side project/inspirational/tech blogging) because I'm not sure what my point of view is. I haven't been working out because I am not sure what my body can tolerate and also because I'm not feeling very energetic. I don't feel like I am experimenting with food and words and ideas the way I know I enjoy.

I'm playing with the idea of doing things that introduce a lot more structure into my life. I usually shy away from fixed commitments such as volunteering at a specific time or attending a class every week, because I know I really appreciate things being able to flow and move and I love uncommitted time. But with working remotely in a much less structured job than I did previously, things have become a bit TOO free flowing and therefore unfocused and a bit listless.

I find writing and sex and cooking and working out to be similar in some ways - the more you do them, the more you want to do them. That's why it feels important to start somewhere, anywhere.

I'm going to experiment with setting up a more regular routine, bookended by lots of opportunities for self care, to help me establish a stabler platform from which to work from. 
I want to scrounge up the energy to actually plan the next big, very vaguely defined endeavours for my job and accomplish them. 
I want to do some volunteering, maybe as a bike mechanic. 
I miss working with my hands and bike work feels a super specific void for me. 
It quiets my mind to slowly fix something.

I will document my attempts.

### Here is a list of things I'd excited to introduce/reintroduce into my life:

* working with my hands in some capacity, physical work. maybe bike repair
* a regular exercise routine that includes weights and cardio
* taking some classes
  * cooking
  * art techniques, graphic journalling
  * wood skills
  * "sex" skills - rope bondage, scene negotiation, what have you. I'd like to do more exploring in this area of my life.
  * singing/piano? 
  * boxing
* volunteering
* a structured writing/creating practice. I have so many ideas and rarely act on them

I can't do all these things at the same time, but I wonder if it is a good idea to try and de-emphasize travelling and being gone so much. I struggle with having less energy, stamina, and get-up-and-go than I used to (which still means I have more than your average person, but I am not quite as superhuman as I used to be) and I also feel the need to keep investing in my personal growth and in my interpersonal relationships.

I'm going to start today - by booking some yoga classes.
