so i returned to working in technology after more than a decade off. I started working as a front end developer in the late 90's, did that for a few years, and then dropped out. the reasons i dropped out aren't that interesting - and at any rate, i always had jobs that were adjacent to tech so it feels not quite true to say that I was entirely disconnected.

When I returned to tech I jumped head first and didn't look back - I completely immersed myself into rebuilding my career. It was one of the best choices I have ever made - my life has been transformed by this decision.

I've found ways to work for the causes I care about while at the same time getting a lot of creative freedom, the opportunity to travel, and also to work with the kinds of smart, ambitious, driven, improvement oriented folks tech is known to attract. Their intensity matches mine - the big dreams and big goals feel incredibly revitalizing to me after more than a decade working with people who mostly get to push paper from one end of the table and back again.

But.

I find myself gasping for air in a way that feels both judging and judged sometimes by the conversations people who work in tech naturally seem to gravitate towards.

I want there to be space for a longer conversation about darkness.

I want to talk about bodies, and feelings.

I want to talk about what it means to be having a body. I want to get out of brains and problem solving and into hands and knees and backs and thighs and everywhere else.

I want to talk about the slow burn of a crush. I want to talk about regrets. I want to talk about the best, most moving music. I want to talk about bad tattoos and not having any money and being sick and the sliding scale clinic and worrying about health insurance and feeling like $20 was a lot. I want to talk about illness. And how we best care for each other. About what we do when the power is shut off and the animals aren't home and the cute stuff is gone and the plants are dead. And how maybe only art and music can save us.

I don't always want to talk about "burnout" or depression or imposter syndrome. I do sometimes. But I want to go beyond being defined by work. I want to talk about beauty. I want to talk about women and I want to talk about desire and what it means to be free. I want to talk more about struggle. And I don't mean struggle to get your ideas recognized or negotiate your salary. I mean actual struggle.

Now, is that a special thing? This wanting to talk about all this? I don't think so but I also don't really see people doing it, and that sometimes makes me feel kind of alone.
